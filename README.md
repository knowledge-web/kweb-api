# K-web API
For this you need (team) access to The Brain (or a copy of the Brain folder).
Will try to start / host `../kweb-ui` also.

```sh
npm install
# start examples
PORT=7575 BRAIN_DIR=../Brain/B02 node .
```

## Thoughts
A general purpose The Brain (HTTP) API could / should be extracted from this... (and then extended for the K-Web).
